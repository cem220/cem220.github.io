# GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY AT LEHIGH
![Geographical](https://github.com/cem220/cem220.github.io/blob/master/Geographical.png?raw=true)
Using information provided by the Lehigh University Office of Institutional Research, I was able to produce an infographic displaying the geographical diversity of the student body at the University. As you can see, a majority  of the students are from New York or New Jersey, with Pennsylvania close behind. Other states in the U.S. make up 28.3% while only a small percentage of students are from other countries. Maybe Lehigh could make it a point to accept more international students to diversify the student body a bit more!
