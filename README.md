# About Me
Hi! My name is Caitlyn Martyn. I am a sophomore at Lehigh University studying Journalism, Marketing and Design. I am from Westchester, New York. I will be using this page to display my various projects created in my Visual Communication class. 
I can be contacted through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlynmartyn/).

# Lehigh University Geographical Diversity
![Geographical](https://github.com/cem220/cem220.github.io/blob/master/Geographical.png?raw=true)
Using information provided by the Lehigh University Office of Institutional Research, I was able to produce an infographic displaying the geographical diversity of the student body at the University. As you can see, a majority  of the students are from New York or New Jersey, with Pennsylvania close behind. Other states in the U.S. make up 28.3% while only a small percentage of students are from other countries. Maybe Lehigh could make it a point to accept more international students to diversify the student body a bit more!


# The Most Visited Countries in the World

Using information from WorldAtlas.com, I created an infographic depicting the top 5 most visited countries in the world. I used mini cameras to symbolize every ten million people, every year. I thought that this would make for an interesting infographic because I could use a vibrant image of one of the countries, making the reader's mind yearn for wanderlust and decide they want to travel.

Here is my practice run, using Timeline for the first time. In class, we were gien the topic of the Rio Olympics.


# Timeline of the History of Nail Polish
<iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1mYZYOmXuXdjGBppk6pwTexQsRNKnYQtNR8uoznMXx6U&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>

Here is my own personal timeline. I created this using various sources online, putting the history together. I picked this topic because I personally wear nail polish all the time and it is something I include in my life day to day. When we were asked to come up with a topic to research and then produce a timeline on our own, I instantly looked at my hands. Your hands are the first and pretty much  only part of your body that you can see at all times. I am always looking at my hands. So that being said, I love to have my nails painted because I think it looks more put together that way. I instantly dove into the topic of nail polish and learned some really interesting things, like warriors were the first to pioneer the idea of putting dye on your finger nails. Alhough I use nail polish for other reasons, it is cool to think that I am sharing something in common with Babylonian warriors that roamed this earth so long ago.

# Line Graph of Undergraduate Men Living in Fraternity Houses and Off-Campus Housing

After using this information provided by the Office of Institutional Research at Lehigh University, I realized a trend that has been increasingly growing since 1998. Around this time, fraternity houses were at their maximum capacity. In the years following, especially in 2000s- many fraternities lost recognition on Lehigh's campus and the members were forced to move out of their houses and to either dorms or off-campus.Their homes were either replaced by sororities or were turned into dorms. Using Kerry Mallett's "Lehigh Lore" column published in the Brown and White several years ago, I was able to piece together how the numbers in the data correlated with actual events recorded in Lehigh's history. In 2000, Zeta Psi Fraternity was removed, moving off-campus and allowing for Alpha Gamma Delta to move in shortly after. In 2003, Phi Delta Theta was removed from its spot on the hill, giving way to the UMOJA house. In 2004, Theta Delta Chi Fraternity was removed from their chapter house, causing them to also move off-campus and the house is now occupied by Alpha Omicron Pi. In 2006, Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, or FIJI, lost recognition and thus their house, which is now an upperclassmen dorm. ALso in 2006, Alpha Sigma Pi lost recognition, moving off campus and letting Kappa Alpha Theta take over the house. In 2007, Alpha Chi Rho failed to fulfill the occupancy requirement, so sorority Alpha Chi Omega took over, leaving the remaining brothers of AXR to move off-campus. In 2008, Beta Theta Pi was removed by their nationals. In 2011,Sigma Alpha Mu was removed and replaced by Zeta Tau Alpha.  Delta Tau Delta was also removed in 2011 and was turned into a dorm until Pi Kappa Alpha moved in a year later. In 2015, Lambda Chi Alpha was removed from their Upper Sayre home, which was turned into a dorm until Delta Chi moved in several years later. The Lambda men were also forced to move off-campus.  As the line graph illustrates, the influx of undergraduate men moving towards off-campus housing and out of fraternity housing indicates that the Greek community was heavily affected, especially in terms of where these men were allowed to live. As the years have gone on, more and more men are moving off campus, out of their fraternity houses. As you can see through the line graph, the trend not only grows every single year- but it has changed so much since just 20 years ago. Lehigh is a different place in so many ways and it is so interesting to be able to create visualizations of the data and come up with some realizations about what is actually going on. The best part is addressing these findings and bringing a story to life.

# Map of Anthropologie Stores Across America
This summer, I will be working at Anthropologie in the Westchester Mall as a Sales Associate. I am so excited to be working for the URBN company since it is so interesting to me. Here are all of the Anthropolgie locations in the U.S. There are some stores in Canada as well as the UK but I decided to focus on the United States. If you can look closer, you can see that Anthropologie stores are in higher-income areas and higher-end store complexes.
